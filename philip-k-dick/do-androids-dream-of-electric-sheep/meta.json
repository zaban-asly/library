But some of them got out of control and escaped. It is due to Rick to find and kill them. He can earn one thousand dollars for each killed android. Rick needs much money to buy a real animal. Now he owns only an electric sheep. But every human must have a real animal. However, killing new generation of androids 'Nexus 6' is not so simple as it may seem...
