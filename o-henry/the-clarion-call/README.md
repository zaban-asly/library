Two weeks later, Detective Barney Woods meets a killer named Kernan while strolling along Broadway. He offers to find a pleasant place and and to talk quietly. The men find a quiet table in the corner. It is late afternoon and there are practically no visitors. Kernan smiles. He is well dressed and confident. Barney Woods is pale. He is in a cheap business suit. 'Why did you kill Norcross?' The detective asked. Kernan is surprised, as he is sure that he did not leave a trace. The detective grabs the gun. 'Get your gun out and I'll tell you everything,' Kernan promises. The killer reveals the unexpected truth.
