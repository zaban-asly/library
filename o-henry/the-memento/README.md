## Description
From the window of Lynette's room, Broadway and many other theaters of this street were perfectly visible. She was an actress and wanted to perform, but there were few offers. Lynette's room was small, but it evoked good memories. On the walls there were photographs of people whom she knew and with whom she socialized in her youth. Professional actors very often stayed in this hotel between performances. There you could relax, and later - look for a job in another theater, when the season of performances started again. Lynette plunged into the memories of pleasant times when there was much more work and she shone on the stage like a real star. Many viewers loved her. But young actresses did not earn enough money for a comfortable life. It was a difficult profession, for those who love the scene.
