At three o’clock terrible screams from a locked house on a Rue Morgue street gathered people, yet no one on the outside could help. Neighbors said that only Madame and Mademoiselle L’Espanayes lived there. With the help of police the party broke in and found a mess inside. By the time police reached the fourth floor there were no more screams. Finally they found the room where the screams had been recently heard.  The scene in the back room was terrible with parts of bloody hair around the apartment and a huge razor covered in blood lying on the chair.  A mother and her daughter were killed in a heartless way by an unknown person with enormous power. Or, it was it a human at all?</span></font></p>",
