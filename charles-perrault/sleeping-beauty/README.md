The two are good old friends, currently at the highest point of their career together. Luke is raising two children with his wife, but Jake's private life consists of little more than some bad habits. Something in their friendship goes wrong as Jake falls in love with his friend’s wife. Luke's suspicions make him feel uncomfortable in Jake's company.
