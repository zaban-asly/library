It is hard to imagine a person who hasn't heard of Charles Perrault and his famous fairy tales. This influential French writer was the founder of the modern fairy tale genre. His works include many well-known stories. The tale 'Little Red Riding Hood' tells a story of a little girl. She is going to visit her grandmother. The old woman is ill and lives far away. Little Red Riding Hood wants to bring her a cake and a small pot of butter. She has to go through the wood. The girl meets a wolf on her way. He is hungry but he can't eat her as he is afrai of the woodcutters working nearby. So he comes up with a clever plan. The wolf decides to arrive at the grandmother's house before Little Red Riding Hood and wait for her there.
