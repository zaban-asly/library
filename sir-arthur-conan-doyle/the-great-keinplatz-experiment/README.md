## Description
Professor Baumgarten is engaged in psychology. He is a great expert in this field. He tries to study the connection of matter and spirit. The professor is more interested in science than in people. It seems to him a good idea to conduct experiments on university students. Many students obey the professor. There is the most devoted assistant among them. Fritz shows great motivation and interest. Other students are surprised - Fritz used to be the laziest student of the university. His enthusiasm is clear when you look at the daughter of the professor. Many are in love with the beautiful girl. Fritz is no exception. Meanwhile, the professor is going to conduct another experiment. He is sure that the soul can live outside the physical body. The situation is getting serious.
