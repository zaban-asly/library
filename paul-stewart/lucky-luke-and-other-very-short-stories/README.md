The barber's name is Jimmy. This man has serious problems with the reporters. The newspapers call him the worst barber in Britain. While cutting the client's hair, Jimmy explains to him the reason for such misfortune. His younger brother Luke has been lucky since childhood. Luke always gets what he wants without any effort. On the contrary, Jimmy himself has been unlucky all his life, despite hard work. Not long ago, Jimmy decided to put an end to his brother's luck. However, things did not go according to the plan.
