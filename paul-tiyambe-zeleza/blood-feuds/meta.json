How does it feel to live in a foreign country and speak a foreign language? You are always a foreigner, in any situation. Two families have been living in Zimbabwe for almost thirty years. Their home country is called Malawi, but they cannot come back there. They believed that one day they would return home. Although the men from these families have disagreements, they try to stick together. After all, they are countrymen. They often talked about the house.
