{"dir":"stephen-bryant/the-story-of-the-internet","title":"The Story of the Internet","creator":"Stephen Bryant","description":"As we know the Internet appeared only a few decades ago. But the idea of connecting several computers together appeared much earlier. Strangely enough, the Cold War played an important part in this process. In 1957 the Soviet Union sent the first artificial Earth satellite in the history into space. It shocked Americans and made them pay more attention to the technological progress in their own country. Many great minds were involved in the creation of what we now call the Internet. They did a lot of work and faced numerous challenges. This book shows a wonderful journey in time. The readers can follow the history of the Internet from the idea of its creation to the present days. They can even speculate what kind of future might wait for this undoubtedly great invention.","version":"v3.2.1","createdAt":"2022-10-04","updatedAt":"2022-10-04","analysis":{"wordsCount":9629,"uniqueWordsCount":1287,"ranks":{"highest":34649,"lowest":1},"levels":{"A1":{"count":368,"readability":54},"A2":{"count":238,"readability":64},"B1":{"count":241,"readability":76},"B2":{"count":206,"readability":85},"C1":{"count":118,"readability":95},"C2":{"count":77,"readability":99}}}}
