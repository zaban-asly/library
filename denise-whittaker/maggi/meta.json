{"dir":"denise-whittaker/maggi","title":"Maggi","creator":"Denise Whittaker","description":"Can you imagine how it is to lose a child? Most of people will not be able to. Most of people don't even want to think about such things, as they are really heartbreaking. Maggie has always been a brave and quick-witted girl. That's what everyone who knew her said. Everything happened during my driving test. I acted in a right way. I checked the mirrors and the belts. The traffic light turned green. Several pedestrians ahead: a woman and two children. The road ahead was thin and not very convenient. Hands on the wheel: for ten hours and two hours, as the instructor taught. I did everything right and recalled. Recently such things happened that it would be better to forget about them. Once and forever. Still it is impossible.","version":"v3.2.1","createdAt":"2022-10-04","updatedAt":"2022-10-04","analysis":{"wordsCount":396,"uniqueWordsCount":239,"ranks":{"highest":18031,"lowest":1},"levels":{"A1":{"count":137,"readability":64},"A2":{"count":36,"readability":76},"B1":{"count":26,"readability":87},"B2":{"count":25,"readability":96},"C1":{"count":8,"readability":98},"C2":{"count":5,"readability":100}}}}
