The reader will get an opportunity to go through Audrey's sad and happy moments from birth till death. She was a kind and a gentle person with a smile on her face, as many her admires remember. But her life wasn't always happy. Her way to success was thorny. Her parents divorced when she was 6 and she survived the Second World War. Ballet was her dream but her appearance wasn't suitable for this kind of art as Audrey had overweight. The years of war and hunger solved this problem. She became very thin and fragile. When she became a bright ballet star, a film director noticed her beauty and grace. Audrey was invited for filming. From that moment her life changed forever.</p>",
