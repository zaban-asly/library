From the top of the hill, he sees a man lying on the ground. The doctor runs for help, and Bobby is trying to provide first aid to the wounded man. The man dies, but before death, he says a mysterious phrase: 'Why did not they ask Evans?' In his pocket, Bobby finds a photo of a beautiful woman. These are the only two keys to understand, who that late man was. Bobby and his friend Frankie are starting their own investigation. They are sure that this was a murder. Later they are attacked by unknown people. The young people understand that they were right.",
