These animals can live in many different places on the planet. These are small invertebrates. In fact, there are many more of them than the familiar mammals, but they are so small that it is too hard to notice them. Among invertebrates, there are most arthropods. This is a creature with six or more limbs. Some of them are insects, others are not. There are a lot of insects on the Earth, more than a million types. Insects have no bones.
