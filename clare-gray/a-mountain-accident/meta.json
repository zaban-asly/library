{"dir":"clare-gray/a-mountain-accident","title":"A Mountain Accident","creator":"Clare Gray","description":"It was a nice summer day. The hard working week was finally over and Aaron Ralston enjoyed the fresh air and clear skies during a leisurely walk. The guy stopped to listen to the silence of the mountains. He wondered how pleasant and good his life was. At this moment a collapse began. The huge stones fell on him and Aaron did not have time to escape. After a few seconds, his hand was pressed with a heavy piece of rock. Aaron remained calm, even though the pain was terrible. He knew how to survive in the wildlife and knew what he should do. Aaron had a small supply of food, a penknife, and willpower. This story is about a man who survived a terrible ordeal, but came home alive. Later, an interesting movie was made about this situation.","version":"v3.2.1","createdAt":"2022-10-04","updatedAt":"2022-10-04","analysis":{"wordsCount":525,"uniqueWordsCount":267,"ranks":{"highest":25529,"lowest":11},"levels":{"A1":{"count":153,"readability":65},"A2":{"count":53,"readability":84},"B1":{"count":32,"readability":94},"B2":{"count":14,"readability":97},"C1":{"count":9,"readability":99},"C2":{"count":4,"readability":100}}}}
