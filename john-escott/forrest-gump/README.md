## Description
It would be a very difficult case to find at least one person on Earth, who did not know the famous film 'Forrest Gump' with Tom Hanks. Certainly, everybody knows and loves this movie. But have you ever read the book on which this film is based? There is a very common situation, when the book is better than the movie. Is this the same case? Let us revise our memories and read a short plot of this story.  'This is a true, wonderful and funny story about Forrest Gump. Forrest is a young kind-hearted man from Alabama in the USA. He has won a medal for gallantry in the Vietnam war. The President Of the United States awarded the hero. Forrest was a footballer, a businessman and a film star. He also went in space. His best friend was an ape called Sue.'
