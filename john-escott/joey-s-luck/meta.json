	"description": "Everything happens at the beginning of the twentieth century. Joey arrives in London from Ireland in January.  January is a cold and windy month in England. Still he does not even have a place to stay. Joey thinks it is not too important. After all, luck will help him. Thanks to his luck, he will find a cozy and inexpensive room where he will rest after the road. Soon he will become a rich man, thanks to his good luck. After all, the real rich men always get lucky. He goes for a walk around the city and after a while finds a room.  It is small, but very cheap. The young man likes it. From the window there is a beautiful view of the Tower Bridge. The guy does not have much time to find a job and pay for the next week. But Joey is sure that luck will not fail this time.",
