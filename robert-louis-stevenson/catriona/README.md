## Description
After coming into his fortune and evading his uncleâ€™s schemes, young gentleman David Balfour continues his adventures in 18th century Scotland, helping a politically unwelcome friend escape into France, avoiding the hangman himself, finding his place as a gentleman in Edinburgh society, and falling in love with the daughter of a notorious Macgregor clansman.
