Thanks to the speakers from this book, many countries have chosen new paths of development. The book begins with an inspiring speech on the rights of African Americans. The speaker is Martin Luther King. This is the time when black people were enslaved and perceived as a commodity, not citizens. Discrimination was considered to be the norm, and everyone took it for granted. But not everyone agreed with this state of affairs. Even today this great man is not forgotten after many years.",
