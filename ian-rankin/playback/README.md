The girl had been dead for three hours already. Detective Rebus discovered a message on the answering machine. That message was from the arrested man. He was talking about their date and telling the girl how he loved her. Obviously, the reason for the murder was jealousy. The knife â€“ murder weapon, was found in the kitchen. All clues pointed to this man, but the captain couldn't understand one thing: what the murderer had been doing for three hours, before they came?</p>
