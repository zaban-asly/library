He is a little over forty. He is very pedantic and keeps things under control, even at home. He writes guides but he hates travelling. His books have detailed instructions on how to feel comfortable in any trip. How to protect your inner world from the intervention of strangers. His son died long ago. This changed the life of the man greatly. His marriage gradually falls apart and turns into nothing. The drama of one person will not leave the reader indifferent.
