One of his humorous works is 'The Medal of Brigadier Gerard'. This is the first book in the series about the title character. Brigadier Gerard is a French soldier during the Napoleonic Wars. He is a brave warrior but not a clever man. In the story he receives and order from the Emperor to deliver a letter to his brother, the King of Spain. Gerard's friend Charpentier gets the same task. But the mission doesn't turn out to be what they expected.
