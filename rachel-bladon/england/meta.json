The River Thames, oatmeal for breakfast, prim gentlemen and the famous detective Sherlock Holmes? In fact, the country has a rich history and culture. This country is the birthplace of the most famous musicians in the world: The Beatles and the Rolling Stones. This country also donated to the world Sir John Tolkien - the writer who founded the fantasy genre. Orcs, hobbits and elves in their present form - this man came up with all these ideas. England is a multicultural country; people speak many languages there. Walking through a small town in the English outback you can meet a representative of each nation on Earth. Also there was one thing invented, which humanity uses every day - shoelaces.","version":"v3.2.1","createdAt":"2022-10-04","updatedAt":"2022-10-04","analysis":{"wordsCount":8167,"uniqueWordsCount":1434,"ranks":{"highest":42296,"lowest":1},"levels":{"A1":{"count":345,"readability":53},"A2":{"count":197,"readability":69},"B1":{"count":214,"readability":80},"B2":{"count":239,"readability":89},"C1":{"count":208,"readability":95},"C2":{"count":146,"readability":99}}}}
