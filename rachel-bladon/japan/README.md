## Description
Some things in Japan always remain the same. Farmers grow rice in the countryside, like the farmers of hundreds of years ago. Year after year, people admire the cherry blossoms in early spring. The Japanese still make tea ceremonies. But there is also something that changes quickly. You do not even have time to realize it. It is about technologies. New advanced robots appear. New phones are more powerful. New computer games are exciting. It is already difficult to distinquish a computer game from reality. There are taller houses and faster trains. This is Japan. The old and the new together. Different traditions and new technologies make it a very interesting country to discover and visit.
