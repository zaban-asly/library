	"description": "<p>The public knew Professor Augustus S. F. X. Van Dusen as The Thinking Machine and perhaps this phrase described him best of all. He always was in his small laboratory where he invented brilliant theories that shocked scientists and had a profound effect on the world. Once he argued with his friends, he tried to convince that \"the mind is master of everything\".\n\"No man can escape from a cell just using only his brain. If it could be possible, no prisoners would be at all. Just let's imagine a case. A cell for prisoners who are condemned to death. These men will do anything to try to escape. Imagine you were in that cell. Could you escape?\"\n\"Certainly, lock me in any cell of any prison where you want in any time, give me only casual clothes and I'll escape from there only in a week.\"</p>",
