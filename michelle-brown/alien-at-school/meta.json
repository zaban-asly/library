She is excited about starting education at a high school. She and her friends dream about handsome and nice teachers, preferably men.

He shocked Jane and her friends at the very first day. Next day they noticed that he drinks strange liquid and takes black pills. His eyes changes their colour from time to time and he talks to sky during his walks outside! Guys have enough clues for considering that their teacher isn't a human.
