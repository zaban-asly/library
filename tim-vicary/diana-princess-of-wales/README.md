## Description
It is very difficult to be a famous person. Not everyone can be such a person with dignity. Some people consciously become famous. Someone gets this right at birth. The future Princess of Wales accepts Prince Charles's offer when she is a young girl in her 20s. This decision is fatal. It changes her life. At first it seems that she has a dream life. But soon the realization comes. You no longer belong to yourself. The photographers follow every step and every movement. Everyone sees a slight wave of your hand. Princess Diana becomes an idol for millions. People love her. They adore her. So they want to know more about her. Perhaps, her popularity is one of the reasons for this tragedy on this terrible night in Paris.
