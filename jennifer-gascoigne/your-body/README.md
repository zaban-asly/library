## Description
Your body is an amazing and complex mechanism. It helps you perform many actions. It can move quickly and lift large weights. You can see, hear and feel the taste. The whole body is covered with skin. Thanks to it, people can touch and feel the surface of things. The skin helps to distinguish between hot and cold objects or air. It also does not allow water to enter the body when a person swims or walks in the pouring rain. Hair grow on the skin. It protects the body from too high or low temperatures. It is also a protection against insects or other external damage. You need to take care of your body so that you always feel good. It is necessary to take a shower regularly, otherwise irritation or drying may appear on the skin. Learn more about the mysteries of the human body by reading this book.
