## Description
<p>Helping Hand is a place where people can get any help they need. Every Saturday morning a big group of teenagers gathers there and waits for tasks. They do different work: help in the garden, go shopping, walk with dogs, babysitting and so on. William works there one day in a week too. Now this organization has a new volunteer Kathy Watson. Today Kathy and William go to the old people's home. They deliver a trolley of books there and offer these books to the old. Kathy meets Miss Emily, who tells her a story about Lord Hampton's house. This house was famous by reach and well-known parties arranging there. Miss Emily worked there many years ago when she was young. In her memories the servants of Lord Hampton were always hungry. However he didnâ€™t take any care of them.</p>
