He began his work and was very pleased. But later strange things started happening. One day he decided that he wanted a cup of coffee. The man left his pen on the table and went out. But when he returned - the pen was gone, even though he was trying to find it. And at night he woke up and realized that there was someone in the room, but nobody was visible.
