One rich little girl stood on the big ship owned her father and sang a song which called the pirates. Twelve-year-old Elizabeth Swann dreamed to meet them. In that day the Dauntless ship got out from the dark water a boy Will Turner. When he was asleep Elizabeth had taken from his shirt a gold medallion with skull and crossbones. The big black ship with the same skull and crossbones on it was sailing past them at that moment. She understood that boy was a pirate. Elizabeth was very afraid, but she hid the medallion under her dress and kept this secret for eight years.</p>
