He decided to ride to the north of the country for study. He rented a small cheap room on the third floor of the old house which was musty and dark. The house itself was large and beautiful as a real palace.  Previously, this house belonged to one ancient noble family. Today, there was only one old woman who earned a living by renting rooms to students. From a small dirty window in his room, Giovanni could see a large, beautiful garden in the courtyard. Once he asked an old woman if this garden belonged to her. But she replied that the owner of a garden was a famous man. His name was Rappaccini. He used plants from the garden in his research. This doctor lived in a small old brown house nearby.","version":"v3.2.1","createdAt":"2022-10-04","updatedAt":"2022-10-04","analysis":{"wordsCount":1234,"uniqueWordsCount":440,"ranks":{"highest":15157,"lowest":1},"levels":{"A1":{"count":237,"readability":67},"A2":{"count":79,"readability":80},"B1":{"count":59,"readability":90},"B2":{"count":44,"readability":96},"C1":{"count":17,"readability":100},"C2":{"count":4,"readability":100}}}}
