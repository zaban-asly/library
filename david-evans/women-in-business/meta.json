	"description": "<p>What do you need to become successful? Is it a luck, a talent or just a hard work? In this book, you will learn about four outstanding women of the XX century. Thanks to their sense of purpose, inner strength and a maniacal desire, they achieved a great success. They made their dreams come true. These women transformed from the charming gentle creatures into the fearsome sharks in various business sectors. They destroyed the old stereotypes, brought some new ideas and gave a chance for new young talented people. Perhaps, there would be no many modern famous and popular stars now if there were no first businesswomen. These ladies were the pioneers in the rude man's world but they managed to get everything they wanted due to their unbelievable persistence and abilities.</p>",
