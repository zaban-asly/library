The August was warmer than usual. All the animals on the plantation were having a rest. Fox was sitting quietly in the shade of a huge tree and drinking cold lemonade. Everything was great, except one thing. It was Rabbit. Fox did not like Rabbit. However, no one loved him. This guy was a lover of dubious jokes and could play a trick on anyone. Before his appearance, the plantation was a quiet, cozy place, but Rabbit came out of nowhere and tricked Fox, Bear, Turtle and  Wolf. His best joke was a scarecrow of resin in a straw hat. He put it in front of Fox's house. Of course, Fox stuck to the man of resin. Since that time, he had been disliking Rabbit.","version":"v3.2.1","createdAt":"2022-10-04","updatedAt":"2022-10-04","analysis":{"wordsCount":594,"uniqueWordsCount":191,"ranks":{"highest":15152,"lowest":11},"levels":{"A1":{"count":109,"readability":53},"A2":{"count":25,"readability":60},"B1":{"count":22,"readability":69},"B2":{"count":24,"readability":91},"C1":{"count":4,"readability":97},"C2":{"count":7,"readability":100}}}}
