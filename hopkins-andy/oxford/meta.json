	"description": "Oxford is not only a world-famous university. It is also the city, in which this university is located. Oxford is ninety kilometres from London - about an hour by car, bus or train. And it is only sixty-four kilometres from the nearest airport. Oxford is not like a typical English city. In the twelfth century, it was one of the main trading cities. Many goods were sold there. The famous university already existed at that time. Nowadays it is considered one of the oldest educational institutions in the world. Oxford is a very interesting city. The most popular buildings here were built in the nineteenth century. This book tells the history of this unique city from its foundation to the present day. ",
