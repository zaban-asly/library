It is swimming out of sight, planning to attack. It is invisible and this scares even more. But the story began even earlier. Amity is a small and very quiet town in the vicinity of New York. Nothing ever happens here. One warm night, a young woman decides to swim in the sea. She does not return home. Soon, the police finds her dead. One of the local police officers decides that a shark appeared near the city. This is a great white shark, which is called the man-eater. Unfortunately, closing the beaches does not work.  Local people start rebelling, because the danger always seems distant. And swimming in the sea is too pleasant on a hot day. No one wants to think about any sharks.
