Her hair was grey, her skin was wrinkled and she looked about sixty years old. A vacuum cleaner and a trolley were nearby. The working day had already ended and she was about to clean.

He had been working with investors for more than ten years. No one had suffered losses during this period. But this time the risk was very high. The cleaning lady was busy with her work.
